SoftWare ARM version 0.27
===========================

Copyright (C) 2000 by Michael Dales. This software is licenced under the Gnu

--------------------------

There are currently 4 supported platforms for SWARM:

* GNU C++ on ix86 Linux
* GNU C++ on Alpha Linux
* Compaq C++ on Alpha Linux
* Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows

Currently the test applications for running on top of SWARM require to be 
built using ARM gcc.

--------------------------
*** Building SWARM using GNU C++ on either Alpha or ix86 Linux.

Assuimg $SWARM is where you installed swarm:

	cd $SWARM/src
	make

There should now be a swarm executable in the src directory. To build 
swarm with debugging symbols type "make debug" instead of just "make".

--------------------------
*** Building SWARM using Compaq C++ on Alpha Linux

This requires you to have downloaded and installed the Beta release of the 
Compaq C++ compiler tools for Alpha Linux. Assuimg $SWARM is where you 
installed swarm:

	cd $SWARM/src
	make alpha-cxx

There should now be a swarm executable in the src directory. To build 
swarm with debugging symbols type "make debug-alpha-cxx" instead of 
just "make alpha-cxx".

--------------------------
*** Building SWARM using Microsoft Visual C++ on Windows

Assuimg $SWARM is where you installed swarm, open $SWARM/msvc/swarm.dsw
in Microsoft Visual C++. The project should simply build.

--------------------------
*** Building the utility programs - Linux only

Assuimg $SWARM is where you installed swarm:

	cd $SWARM/bin
	make

A directory should be created in $SWARM/bin for your architecture containing
the compiled files.

--------------------------
*** Building the test applications

Assuimg $SWARM is where you installed swarm:

	cd $SWARM/test_apps
	make

Currently these assume that the ARM targetted GNU tools are in a specific
place. You should edit $SWARM/test_apps/Makefile and update the lines:

CC = /usr/local/gnuarm/bin/arm-unknown-coff-gcc
LD = /usr/local/gnuarm/bin/arm-unknown-coff-ld 
OC = /usr/local/gnuarm/bin/arm-unknown-coff-objcopy

Change these to provide the correct location for your ARM tools.
