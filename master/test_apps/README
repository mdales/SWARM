The test apps are quite simple. Here's a brief description of what they do. 
Unless specified they don't produce any output, but you can look at /tmp/mem
to see the final state of the simulator's memory.

test1 - Simple Fibonnaci generator.

test2 - Reads in data/coffee.bmp and applies an edge detection filter to the
        image. The results can be found in /tmp/coffee.bmp.

test3 - Test of memcpy.

test4 - Simple printf test.

filter - Similar to test2 but does sharpen.
